cryptokit
=========

Utilities for working with bitcoin (or altcoin) data structures. Decode raw
transactions and build merkle trees or branches to confirm valid blocks.
Includes basic tests that run against a running bitcoin (or litecoin, etc)
instance and confirm that structures serialize/deserialize like the servers.

Full credit to sources that I've read/morphed/copied to create this package:
* Eloipool, luke-jr
* P2Pool, forrestv
